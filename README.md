### Introduction
B is a custom programming language I made because I don't like c++ very much (B's compiler is written in c++ though), I mean I really like c++ but some syntax/format is kind of annoying and sometimes it bugs your whole project.  
The base syntax and formatting I would say is quite similar to C# or Python, but differs as task complexity increases.

***B scripts have the file extension of .b, .black, and .bx.***  
***This programming language will support graphics.***
